## README.md

This file provides a line-by-line explanation of the following C++ code:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
    std::cout << "Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud";

    return 0;
}
```

### `#include <iostream>`

This line is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file. The `iostream` header file contains the declarations for the standard input and output streams, which are used to read and write data to the console.

### `int main ()`

This line declares the `main()` function, which is the entry point for the program. The `int` keyword indicates that the `main()` function returns an integer value. The parentheses after `main` indicate the function's parameter list. In this case, the `main()` function does not take any parameters.

### `std::cout << "Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud";`

This line uses the `std::cout` object to print the string "Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud" to the console. The `<<` operator is the insertion operator, which is used to insert data into a stream. In this case, the data being inserted is the string "Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud".

### `return 0;`

This line returns an integer value of 0 from the `main()` function. This is a standard way to indicate that the program has executed successfully.

### Summary

This C++ program prints the string "Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud" to the console.

I hope this explanation is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
